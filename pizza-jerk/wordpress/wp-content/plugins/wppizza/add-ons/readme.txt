NOTE:
	this documentation and the skeleton files will expand and better documented when I get the chance.
	
	for the time being:
		
	wppizza-gateway-mygateway.zip 
	
	basic skeleton gateway to implement your own gateway credit card implementation according to your gateway API

	unzip and replace filenames and instances of "mygateway" as required and place into your plugins directory
	
	read the comments in the files, update/edit/changes as necessary
	
	currently only documented for hosted payment pages (i.e redirection to gateway for payment) - ajax overlay docs will follow in due course 

	although gateway implementation  may change in the future , i will still cater for this way of implementaion if at all possible
